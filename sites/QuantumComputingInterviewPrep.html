    <!-- Chosen Palette: Quantum Calm (Slate, Indigo, White) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page interactive revision dashboard with a fixed sidebar for navigation. This structure was chosen over a linear document to allow the user to quickly jump between topics—Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Computing, and Hardware—which is crucial for last-minute interview preparation. The main content area uses interactive 'concept cards.' Clicking a card expands to show detailed information, equations, and diagrams. This approach breaks down complex information into manageable chunks, preventing overwhelm and facilitating focused revision. The goal is a task-oriented flow: select a high-level topic, drill down into specific concepts, and review key details efficiently. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Qubit states (|0>, |1>, superposition). Goal: Inform/Explain. Viz/Presentation: A dynamic bar chart representing the probabilities of measuring |0> or |1>. Interaction: A slider to change the state vector α and β coefficients, which updates the chart in real-time. Justification: Provides a simple, intuitive visual for the abstract concept of superposition. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Quantum Logic Gates (Hadamard, CNOT). Goal: Organize/Explain. Viz/Presentation: Interactive diagrams built with HTML divs and CSS. Interaction: Hovering over a gate symbol reveals its matrix representation and a short description. Justification: More effective than static text for understanding quantum circuits. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Comparison of different qubit hardware platforms. Goal: Compare. Viz/Presentation: An interactive horizontal bar chart. Interaction: Buttons to sort the chart by metrics like 'Coherence Time' or 'Gate Fidelity'. Justification: Allows quick comparison of key hardware trade-offs. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Key equations (Schrödinger, etc.). Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation: Presented in formatted text blocks with togglable annotations. Interaction: Clicking terms in an equation reveals a plain-language explanation. Justification: Deconstructs complex math for easier revision. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS (using KaTeX for rendering).
