This structure guides the user through the paper's logical argument, from the established belief (The Claim) to the theoretical basis (The Model) and then to the core critique (The Reality). The "Reality" section uses an interactive tabbed interface to break down complex physical obstacles (Side Channels, Holography, etc.) into digestible pieces. This is more user-friendly than a linear paper format, encouraging exploration of the core argument. -->

                To "prove" QKD is secure, scientists use a theoretical model. This model simplifies the world to make the mathematics solvable. This section illustrates that simplified model and highlights the critical assumptions it makes. The paper's core argument is that these assumptions are not physically realistic.
